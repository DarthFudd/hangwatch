.Hangwatch FAQ

What does `hangwatch` do?::
    Hangwatch periodically polls `/proc/loadavg`, and echos a
    user-defined set of characters into `/proc/sysrq-trigger` if a
    user-defined load threshold is exceeded.

Why not just run a script from `cron`?::
    When the system is under heavy load, fork() calls may fail
    or hang indefinitely, making cron jobs and shell scripts useless.

Wouldn't `loadwatch` be a more accurate name?::
    Yes, it would.  Many hangs are actually the result of very
    rapid load spikes which never show up in logs, because the
    applications that would be logging the load spike cannot run.
    Calling it `hangwatch` convinces people to run it even if they
    haven't seen load spikes with their hangs.

Why not use NMI watchdog?::
    NMI watchdog and hangwatch complement each other.  NMI watchdog
    will fire when the system is completely hung, but not when it is
    simply too bogged down to get any real work done.  Hangwatch will
    fire when the system is too bogged down to get work done, but
    probably won't help for a hard lockup.  System hangs that do not
    trigger either NMI watchdog or hangwatch are extremely rare in
    my experience.

Do I have to compile it myself?::
    This RPM provides a compiled version of hangwatch and installs
    configuration files for you. You can use the SRPM to compile
    hangwatch for other architectures if desired.

How do I make hangwatch start at boot time?::
    The RPM installs a SysV-style init script. 
    Run `chkconfig hangwatch on` to enable boot-time startup.
    Run `service hangwatch start` to invoke it now.

How do I make hangwatch run with higher priority?::
    Set the NICE variable in `/etc/sysconfig/hangwatch`. 
	See `man nice` for details.

How do I make hangwatch run with realtime priority?::
    Set the RTPRIO variable in `/etc/sysconfig/hangwatch`. 
    See `man chrt` for details.

How do I make hangwatch run on a particular processor?::
Set the CPUS variable in `/etc/sysconfig/hangwatch`. 
See `man taskset` for details.  
+
This is particularly useful
if you bind hangwatch to a certain processor and bind the
troublesome application to the other processors.  The default
/etc/sysconfig/hangwatch` configures hangwatch to run on CPU0 only.
+
The simplest way to force troublesome applications to other
processors is to boot with the kernel parameter `isolcpus=0`. This
excludes CPU0 from the process scheduler so that applications
are scheduled on other CPUS only. This has effects on latency
and CPU service time, so consider the performance ramifications
before booting with the isolcpus parameter. Other ways to bind
processes to particular CPUS include `taskset(1)`, `numactl(8)`,
and cpusets (see `scheduler_domains.txt` in the kernel-doc).

Where does the output of hangwatch go?::
    This depends on your syslog configuration, but generally
    it will at least go to the boot console (serial terminals
    and netconsole help for recording this) and will also go to
    `/var/log/messages` if the system is responsive enough to write to
    that file.

How do I create different triggers for different load thresholds?::
    For now, the init script will invoke up to three instances
    of hangwatch based on variables in `/etc/sysconfig/hangwatch`:
    LOAD_THRESH_1, LOAD_THRESH_2, and LOAD_THRESH_3.
    SYSRQ_1, SYSRQ_2, and SYSRQ_3.

How can I collect a vmcore with hangwatch?::
    Put `c` at the end of your string of sysrq characters.
    The sysrq-c trigger causes a controlled kernel panic, which should
    allow netdump, diskdump, kdump, etc. to work properly.

Will you please add feature X to hangwatch?::
    Maybe.  Because of the circumstances under which it
    operates, hangwatch must always be a very lightweight program.
    After startup, it can't do anything that might have problems
    under heavy load.  That said, there are lots of other interesting
    pseudofiles it could potentially work with.  Patches are welcome.
