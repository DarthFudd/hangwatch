Hangwatch was originally developed by Chris Snook while
he was at Red Hat, Inc. It was picked up by Adam Stokes
somewhat recently.

This package includes several doc files:

FAQ.orig: the original FAQ from Chris with additions
	from Paul Morgan several years ago.

FAQ.astokes: the current mini-FAQ from Adam Stokes as published at 
	http://people.redhat.com/astokes/hangwatch/

README.asciidoc: the original FAQ converted into asciidoc
